I'm planning to delve forward with understanding more about Computer Vision. Be a part of the journey, while I post my projects, knowledge snippets on the same. Happy Learning!

## Projects 
1. Dogs vs Cats - A basic CNN code which classifies Dogs and Cats, with a hint of how Image Generator method from Tensorflow works, oragnizing the image files, and visualzing the layers.
2. Dogs vs Cats v2 - A version 2 of the Project 1, supported with augmentations and the benefits of Transfer Learning!
3. Class Activation Maps - https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/class_activation_maps: A CAM is a weighted activation map generated for each image, helps to identify the region a CNN is looking at while classifying an image.
4. A fun little project for drawing bounding boxes for Object Detection - https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/rectangle_bbox (Used OpenCV)
5. Implementating ResNet18 for Image Classification using Pytorch

## Knowledge Bytes
1. Stanford's Computer Vision course-notes forked links - [CS131](https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/cs131_notes) & [CS231a](https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/cs231a-notes)
