Here are some of the projects that I created while learning Computer Vision from some of the courses and books-

## Projects 
1. Dogs vs Cats - A basic CNN code which classifies Dogs and Cats, with a hint of how Image Generator method from Tensorflow works, oragnizing the image files, and visualzing the layers.
2. Dogs vs Cats v2 - A version 2 of the Project 1, supported with augmentations and the benefits of Transfer Learning! (using Tensorflow)
3. Class Activation Maps - https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/class_activation_maps: A CAM is a weighted activation map generated for each image, helps to identify the region a CNN is looking at while classifying an image.
4. A fun little project for drawing bounding boxes for Object Detection - https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/rectangle_bbox (Used OpenCV)
5. Implementating ResNet18 for Image Classification using Pytorch
6. ObjectDetection using selecctivesearch and RCNN
