# Computer Vision Projects

I'm planning to delve forward with understanding more about Computer Vision. Be a part of the journey, while I post my projects, knowledge snippets on the same. Happy Learning!

## Projects 
1. Dogs vs Cats - A basic CNN code which classifies Dogs and Cats, with a hint of how Image Generator method from Tensorflow works, oragnizing the image files, and visualzing the layers.


## Knowledge Bytes
1. Stanford's Computer Vision course-notes forked links - [CS131](https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/cs131_notes) & [CS231a](https://github.com/nsrinidhibhat/cs231a-notes)
